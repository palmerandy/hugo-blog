I am a software developer in Melbourne, Australia, working for [Virgin Pulse](https://www.linkedin.com/company/virgin-pulse/).  

My programming skills are primarily in the .NET Framework and .NET core using C#.  I regularly extend into HTML, JavaScript, CSS and SQL.  I embrace learning all technologies and have spent time professionally throughout many areas of the programming stack, including Web, Windows, iOS, SharePoint, and Data Warehousing solutions.

- I have experience in the complexities of large Government agencies and Financial institutions as well as smaller companies operating globally within the private sector.
- I specialise in architecting Cloud friendly (highly available and scalable) solutions within Microsoft's Azure platform. 
- I enjoy working with people to elicit and analyse requirements to ensure the best solution is designed and delivered for the problem at hand.
- I attend various development meet-ups across Melbourne.
- I'm an avid endurance runner, having recently completed my fourth marathon.
