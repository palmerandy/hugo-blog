I've never liked *Hello World* examples to understand a new technology.  Recently I have been employing a new technique of building a small application that I have a passion for.

For me my passion is running, so instead of building *Hello World* I build a *Running Pace Calculator*.

Here are some recent technologies I worked with:

- [blazor web assembly](https://palmerandy.github.io/Running-Pace-Calculator/)
- [react](https://palmerandy.github.io/Running-Calculator-React/)
